I have experience in robotics, software development, control engineering and teamwork in an international environment.

I am the winner of the grand prize and mentorship award (together with the Team) in the Startup Weekend RzeszÃ³w #2 competition for the DiluDiluBlocks educational toy project for children (uP AVR, C) and a finalist in the Rzethon by G2A hackathon for the MarsRover project (Arduino, C++).

I have a wealth of interdisciplinary experience gained from industrial internships, working professionally, running my own company and working on an inspection robot project at startup CCTVRobotics.

I am interested in new technologies, electronics, programming, the IT industry, travelling and continuously improving my skills.
